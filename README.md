Welcome to our entry for the the O'Reilly Winter 2024 Architectural Katas. We, the System Savants team, are a team of engineers from the health insurance and health services sector. With common objectives of learning and having fun, the team embarked on journey to create a solution for the stated problem. The aim of this documentation git repository is to communicate our design for the problem described for technical and non-technical team audiences alike.

Here's our [five-minute video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP2wVbwkYJA) for the O'Reilly Architectural Kata.

Actors, Actions, and Components

**First Draft**

#### Selected Architecture Characteristics

| Top 3 | Driving Characteristics      | Source                                                       |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Y     | Interoperability/Integration | Integration of patient's vital sign devices with MonitorMe (analyzing streaming data), and with MyMedicalData. |
|       | Data Integrity               | Vital sign data analyzed and recorded through MonitorMe must be as accurate as possible as the human lives are at stake. |
|       | Scalability/Elasticity       | StayHealthy, Inc. is looking towards adding more vital sign monitoring devices for MonitorMe in the future. |
| Y     | [Real-Time] Performance      | Vital signs data is send to consolidated monitoring screen with an average response time of 1 second or less. |
| Y     | High Availability            | System needs to be available all the times as the medical professional need to monitor patients vitals and take decision based on them. |
|       | Deployability                | We are proposing a combination of microservices and event-driven architecture with a service for each device ,being able to deploy the whole system seemlessly is important. |

#### Implicit Architecture Characteristics

The following are a bedrock of architecture characteristics. They may not affect the *structure* but will feed into the overall architecture.

- Usability
- Security, authentication and authorization
- Maintainability
- Simplicity or observability



#### Capacity Planning

![CapacityPlanning](assets/images/CapacityPlanningData.png)


#### Architecture Style Analysis & Selection

The above characteristics are highlighted below in green, with data integrity, above, not included in the matrix below. Data integrity will be a key architecture characteristic of the [data store selected](DataStore.md), along with the interface to this data store.

*Both Microservices and Event Driven architecture options have trade-offs, so we decided to go with a commbination of both microservices and event driven.*
